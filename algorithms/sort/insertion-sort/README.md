# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that divides the list to be sorted into a left sorted portion and a right unsorted portion, with the sorted portion initially containing only the first item in the list. The list is then iterated through, and with each iteration, the first item in the unsorted part is compared to items in the sorted part, and inserted in its rightful position with respect to the items currently in the sorted portion.
